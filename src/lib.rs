//! The base of the EH3D machine-control program that will hold the drilling mode, the routing mode and the 2D and 3D CNC work. For now it
//! is the view of a job (the scene on the table, the themes and the words of the interface), which lives in `eh3d-view` of EH3D-COMMON
//! and is shared with the other programs of the suite; it is re-exported here so that this program uses it under its own name.
