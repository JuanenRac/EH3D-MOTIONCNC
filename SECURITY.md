# Security policy

EH3D-MOTIONCNC is a window over a machine controller. It reads no files from other people except the G-code file the operator chooses (read as text, never run by itself) and a theme file written by a user, which is checked rather than trusted. It opens a serial port only when it is started for GRBL (`--grbl`, a build with `--features serial`), and a network connection only to the EH3D server whose address is in its settings, when the operator sends a program to it. The token for the server is kept as text in the settings file of the user: keep that file private.

What this repository does **not** do: it has not driven a real machine, it is not a safety system and it does not handle limit switches or an emergency stop. Do not connect a machine to it.

## Reporting a problem

Please report a vulnerability privately to **electrohobby3d@gmail.com**, with the steps that show it. Do not open a public issue for it. You will get an answer as soon as possible; this is a one-person project.
