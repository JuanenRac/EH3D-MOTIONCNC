**Honesty check - what actually runs today:** a Rust program with a window (`motioncnc`) that drives a **simulated** machine: it shows the position of the machine (work and machine), moves it by hand with a jog pad, sets the zero, homes, takes the commands typed by the operator, runs a G-code program line by line (with pause, stop and the emergency stop), draws the path of the program on the table with the lines done marked, and stops at what the controller refuses. The window speaks 37 languages and wears eleven themes. The controller interface (`eh3d-controller`, in EH3D-COMMON) has GRBL written against a scripted line and lists the other families as not driven yet. 30 tests run on a computer. **Nothing here has run on a real machine**, no serial port or network connection is opened, and arcs and the other codes are neither drawn nor run by the simulator.

---

> **Safety and security status:** this program drives only a simulated machine: it opens no serial port and no network connection. When a real controller is connected it will have to prove itself on a simulator and then on a real machine before it is called working, and the limit switches and an emergency stop stay the job of the machine's own control unit; the emergency stop of the window is not a safety circuit.

## 🚦 Project status

Each line is one part of this repository and the light says how far it is today. It is written from what the repository can show (tests, builds, runs), not from what is planned.

🟢 Done and verified · 🟡 Works, with known limits · 🟠 Partly done or not verified yet · 🔴 Not done or not working

| Area | State | What it means here |
|---|---|---|
| Base library | 🟡 | A Rust crate that re-exports `scene`, `texts` and `theme` of `eh3d-view` under this program's name; it needs the folder of EH3D-COMMON next to it. |
| Scene and views | 🟡 | Written and tested in EH3D-COMMON; the window of this program draws the path of a program on the table and the position of the tool (seen on a computer). |
| Themes and texts | 🟡 | Eleven themes and the words of the interface in 37 languages, seen in the window of this program. |
| Tests | 🟡 | 30 tests pass on a computer (`cargo test --features gui`): the session (jog, zero, home, a program, pause, alarm, emergency stop), the path of a program and the command line; the simulated controller is tested in EH3D-COMMON. |
| Window and jog | 🟡 | Works on a computer with the simulated controller: position, jog pad, steps, feed, home, zero, unlock, a line of commands and a log; no real machine. |
| Machine control | 🟠 | Only the simulator: a program runs line by line with pause, stop and the emergency stop; no real controller is connected from here yet. |
| Documentation | 🟡 | README in eight languages, the two pictures, three sample programs and the changelog. |

## 🎯 Overview

* The **window** (`src/gui.rs`, `motioncnc`): the position of the machine (work and machine), a jog pad with its steps and feed, home, zero and unlock, the emergency stop, a line of commands with its log, and the program with its path on the table.
* The **session** (`src/session.rs`): what the program does with any controller of `eh3d-controller`: jog, zero, home, send a line, run a program line by line, pause, stop and the alarms; it is tested on the simulated controller.
* The **path of a program** (`src/gcode.rs`): the straight moves (`G0`, `G1`, absolute or relative, in mm or inches) drawn before the program runs; arcs are not drawn.
* The **simulated controller** (`eh3d_controller::sim`, in EH3D-COMMON): a machine in memory with travel limits that raise an alarm; the controller families of the market are listed in `eh3d-controller`, GRBL is the first one written and the others show as not driven yet.
* The **themes and the words** of `eh3d-view`: Forge (the default), Neon Arcade, Glass Pro, the classic Windows grey and one that follows Windows, and the interface in English, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese. What it will be: one program to drill, to route and to do 2D and 3D CNC work on the engines of EH3D-DRILLPRO and EH3D-ROUTEPRO; that part does not exist yet.
* The **menus, the settings and the files**: the menus File, View, Program, Machine and Help with what PlanetCNC has in them (open, recent files, save, edit, the zeros, the stored positions, the spindle and the coolant); a settings window (units, language, eleven themes, travel limits, jog) that is kept between runs; and the Open and Save windows of the suite (`eh3d-filedialog`: places, sorting, filters, the extension of a saved file and the question before a file is replaced).
* **GRBL on a serial port:** built with `--features serial`, `motioncnc --grbl PORT[@BAUD]` drives a GRBL controller (115200 baud by default) instead of the simulator and `motioncnc --ports` lists the serial ports; a build without the feature, or a port that does not open, says so and leaves. It has been tried only against a scripted controller, never against a real one.
* **A window that follows the screen:** it opens maximized, and from 720p to 1080p and on to larger and wider screens everything grows or shrinks with it.
* **Going on after a failure:** while a program runs, the line it has reached is saved to a small file; if the window, the computer or the link goes down, the next start asks whether to go on from that line or to leave it. Nothing is sent to the controller until the operator answers.

## 🧩 Role in EH3D

EH3D-MOTIONCNC is the machine-control program of EH3D, today working on a simulated machine. It depends by path on EH3D-COMMON (the folder `EH3D-COMMON` must sit next to this one: the view, the themes, the words and the controllers) and on no other EH3D repository yet.

## 🔒 Security & Safety

This program opens no serial port, no network connection and no file of other people except the G-code file the operator chooses (read as text, never run by itself). It drives a simulated machine only and is not a safety system. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## 🚀 Quick start

You need a stable Rust toolchain and the folder `EH3D-COMMON` next to this one.

```bash
cargo build --release --features gui
cargo test --features gui
cargo clippy --all-targets --features gui -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
python -I tools/ci_validate.py
cargo run --release --features gui -- examples/02_frame_and_pocket.nc
```

`build.bat` / `build.sh` build the program, `test.bat` / `test.sh` run the tests and `run.bat` / `run.sh` open the window on a sample program. The scripts wait for a key at the end unless `NOPAUSE` is set.

## 🧪 Testing

`cargo test --features gui` runs 30 tests: the session (jog and zero, a program run line by line, pause and go on, a refused line, the emergency stop and the alarm, the log of the commands, homing), the path of a program and the command line; the view and the simulated controller are tested in EH3D-COMMON. The CI also runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy` with warnings as errors, and `python -I tools/ci_validate.py` checks the manifest, the versions, the changelog and the eight READMEs.

## 🏗️ Build & Release

The version lives in `Cargo.toml` and in `eh3d.project.json`, and each version has its entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). There is no program to package yet, so there are no ready-made binaries.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Known limits

**Known limits today**

* Nothing here has run on a real machine: the controller is a simulator and no serial port or network connection is opened.
* The simulator takes only basic G-code (`G0`, `G1`, `G90`, `G91`, `G20`, `G21`, `G92`, `M3` to `M9`); arcs, canned cycles and probing are refused, and the path of a program does not draw arcs.
* It needs the folder `EH3D-COMMON` next to it, because it depends on it by path.

**Next**

* A real controller: GRBL over a serial port first, then the other families, then the controller of HYDRA-UMC.
* Arcs and the rest of the G-code in the simulator and in the path.
* A 3D view of the path with the height of the cuts.
* Probing, the tool changer and the materials of the machine.
* Join the engines of EH3D-DRILLPRO and EH3D-ROUTEPRO so that one program drills and routes.

## 🌍 Languages

README and texts exist in English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Japanese and European Portuguese.

## 🤝 Contributing & Community

* Before a pull request run `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` and `python -I tools/ci_validate.py`: all must pass. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* The README exists in eight languages: a change to the text is made in all eight files, and the two pictures are drawn from `docs/architecture.json` and `docs/structure.json` by `tools/make_architecture.py` and `tools/make_structure.py`.
* Do not describe as working what has not been run on a machine.
* Report a vulnerability privately: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Questions, ideas and reports: electrohobby3d@gmail.com ([SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md)).
